    {font=PTSerif.ttf}The spacecraft OSIRIS-REx briefly made contact
    with the asteroid 101955 Bennu in 2020. NASA
    scientist Daniella DellaGiustina reports that despite
    facing the unexpected obstacle of a surface mostly
    covered in boulders, OSIRIS-REx successfully
    _______ a sample of the surface, gathering pieces of
    it to bring back to Earth.

    {font=PTSerif.ttf}Research conducted by planetary scientist Katarina
    Miljkovic suggests that the Moon’s surface may not
    accurately _______ early impact events. When the
    Moon was still forming, its surface was softer, and
    asteroid or meteoroid impacts would have left less
    of an impression; thus, evidence of early impacts may no longer be present.

    {font=PTSerif.ttf}Handedness, a preferential use of either the right or
    left hand, typically is easy to observe in humans.
    Because this trait is present but less _______ in
    many other animals, animal-behavior researchers
    often employ tasks specially designed to reveal
    individual animals’ preferences for a certain hand
    or paw.
